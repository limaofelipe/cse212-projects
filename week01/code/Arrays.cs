        // Remember: Using comments in your program, write down your process for solving this problem
        // step by step before you write the code. The plan should be clear enough that it could
        // be implemented by another person.

        // Step 1: First, check for special situations where we don't need to rotate at all.
        // For example, if the list is empty, null, or if rotating by a full cycle
        // (like 9 times for a list of 9 items) would just bring us back to the original list.

        // Step 2: Make sure the rotation amount makes sense by reducing it to a smaller number 
        // if it's bigger than the list size.
        // This is done by using the remainder when dividing the amount by the list's length.

        // Step 3: Figure out how many positions we actually need to rotate after simplifying the amount.
        // effectiveAmount is the remainder when we divide the original rotation amount by the list size.
        // This is important because rotating a list by its full size (or multiples of it) brings it back to the start,
        // so we only care about the leftover amount. For example, rotating a list of 9 items by 10 positions
        // is the same as rotating by 1 position (since 10 divided by 9 is 1 with a remainder of 1).
        // effectiveAmount tells us exactly how many items to move from the end to the front of the list.

        // Step 4: Split the list into two pieces: the part that will move to the front (the last few items)
        // and the part that will stay at the end (the first part of the original list).

        // Step 5: Put together a new version of the list by placing the moved-to-front part first,
        // followed by the part that was originally at the beginning.

        // Step 6: Replace the contents of the original list with this newly arranged list.
